#### See the potential impact of the change Tracy can make

When Tracy is exploring the fact that is accurate/inaccurate 

She wants to know what impact she personally make on the climate

So that she can take action 

Key considerations: 

- Make climate change digestible and actionable to overrule misinformation.
- promote positive effects rather than environmental ones such as societal benefits.
- communication should focus on how mitigation efforts can promote a better society, rather than focusing on the reality of climate change and averting its risks.

Show the impact of a change they can make, e.g. 

''If you stopped taking a new coffee cup every day, a whole year of keep cup use would equal to 10 new planted trees.''
