We  discussed the  need to 
- add easily  discoverable starter issues for new joiners
- describe more clearly  what we are doing, the duration we  spend on one part of  a project and  our timelines. This remind me of  a project road map and white paper.
- get  financial reporting data
- decide how to detect  greenwashing on twitter. Are hashtags for  earth day enough?
- investigate the possibilty  of  tweaking existing pre-trained engines to respond to greenwashing.
- investigate the cost  of running a bot and  hosting options
