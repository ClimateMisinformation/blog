## Product canvas

The product team made an in depth analysis of the need for product we could build.

    var panel = ram_design;
    if (backup + system) {
        file.readPoint = network_native;
        sidebar_engine_device(cell_tftp_raster,
                dual_login_paper.adf_vci.application_reader_design(
                graphicsNvramCdma, lpi_footer_snmp, integer_model));
    }

## Personas and the product

Here  we describe expected users of a climate mis-information tool and their possible motivations  for using our tool.

## Assumption validation

Our assumptions are described in the issues log. Reviewing them is a useful task for new contributers. 

## Keywords for scraping Twitter dataset

## [Labelled data from scraping](LabelledDataFromArticleScrape.md)
We used our [scraping tools](https://github.com/ClimateMisinformation/Scrapers)  to scrape the websites described [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S_pv0cFsYCdrJFp8M-Tc_Vbk221PvhtnCe-QaBr8rQw/edit?usp=sharing).
The articles were labelled by our team using a [docanno](https://doccano.herokuapp.com/) instance running on the cloud.  The project and labels were exported [here](labelled_data/doccano). They  cam be imported into other doccano instances.
