## [Labelled data from scraping](LabelledDataFromArticleScrape.md)
We used our [scraping tools](https://github.com/ClimateMisinformation/Scrapers)  to scrape the websites described [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S_pv0cFsYCdrJFp8M-Tc_Vbk221PvhtnCe-QaBr8rQw/edit?usp=sharing).
The articles were labelled by our team using a [docanno](https://doccano.herokuapp.com/) instance running on the cloud.  The project and labels were exported [here](labelled_data/doccano). They  cam be imported into other doccano instances.
